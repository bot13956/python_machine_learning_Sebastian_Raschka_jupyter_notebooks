# python_machine_learning_Sebastian_Raschka_jupyter_notebooks

This repository contains python codes written in jupyter notebook files from the book: Python Machine Learning - Sebastian Raschka.

There will be one notebook for each chapter of the book. Notebooks for corresponding chapters will be added progressively. Each notebook will contain blocks of python codes, written under different headings, which correspond to sections in the Python Machine Learning book. In some of the notebooks, there will be sections where I have added an additional code to complement or show an alternative way in which a code could be written. For example, in chapter_01.ipynb, I have added the section "My addition: A little introduction to seaborn" to introduce the seaborn library.
